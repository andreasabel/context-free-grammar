Notes for context-free-grammar.

TODOs:

look at removeCycles and removeCycles'
firstmap is not fully inhabited
Reachable is included in Cfg but none of the others

Should the arguments of cpretty be flipped?  I'm usually currying on
the context.  Answer is no, because we want to use it as a Monad.
Context comes last because it's the constant in the MonadReader.
Can't change that.

I'd like to write Functor and Bifunctor instances of FreeCfg, but it
requires that t and nt live in Ord, but you can't mention either.  Do
I do the discouraged thing and put context on the type declaration?
Nope, that doesn't work either.

I note that Set is not a member of Functor for probably the same
reasons.

So maybe I don't need bifunctors because these aren't members of
Bifunctor.  If I wrote them as lists instead, they would be.  But I
don't think that's worth it.

And now that I'm trying to implement productionRules, I see that
Bifunctor is problematic when you've got type arguments in both
positive and negative positions.  So scrap it all.
