0.2.0 (2015-xx-xx):
    - Removed nullables from the Analysis record.  removeUnproductives
      can now fail in the case where the start symbol was
      unproductive.  Replaced CPretty (a premature overgeneralization)
      with Pretty.  Added treatment of left-recursion.
0.1.0 (2015-04-02):
    - Restructured API so default is to keep partial analysis results;
      old way was too error-prone.
0.0.1 (2015-03-14):
    - Initial version.
